We are pleased to announce that we will be attending the 62nd International Spinal Cord Society Annual Scientific Meeting ([ISCoS 2023](https://iscosmeetings2023.org/)) in Edinburgh in October. We will be presenting some of the work as part of the workshop on 'The state of the art in restoration of upper limb function for tetraplegic patients'.
